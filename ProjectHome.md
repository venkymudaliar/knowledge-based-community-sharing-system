Today most of the Educational
institutions in India are understaffed and does not have a basic
interaction with industry. It now exists in such a way that
Industries are now not part of the education system. Providing an
environment for students/ faculty/ researcher/ industry experts will
drive us to make up an online knowledge centre for education and
research. The basic idea of KBCSS is to provide an environment for
the students and faculty of a university to enhance their technical
skills and to share their knowledge with their fellow students or
faculty/ researchers/ industrial experts. It also aims to provide a
platform for mutual cooperation between different kinds of users,
learning by mining(i.e., previous discussions are a source which is
studied). The system was proposed to replace the existing e-learning
systems of many universities and colleges which are unidirectional
i.e., from faculty to students to a bidirectional way i.e., also
from student to faculty.
